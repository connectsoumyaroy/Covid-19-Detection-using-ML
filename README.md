## **Background**  
- **Timeline:**  
  - The novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.  
  - On December 31, 2019, it was reported to the **World Health Organization (WHO)**.  
  - On February 11, 2020, WHO named the virus COVID-19.  
  - The outbreak was declared a **public health emergency** shortly thereafter.  

- **Transmission and Symptoms:**  
  - COVID-19 spreads through the respiratory tract when an infected person comes into contact with a healthy individual.  
  - Symptoms typically appear within **2-14 days** and include:  
    - **Moderate to Severe Cases:** Dry cough, fatigue, and fever.  
    - **Severe Cases:** Dyspnea, fever, and fatigue.  
  - Individuals with pre-existing conditions like asthma, diabetes, and heart disease are at higher risk of severe illness.
